# RAG Knowledge Assistant

### **Overview**

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for creating a knowledge assistant. Users can upload their own knowledge and query it using natural language. The system integrates **Angular** for the frontend, **Node.js (Express, TypeScript)** for the backend, and a **FastAPI (Python)** service for generating embeddings and interacting with a local **DeepSeek** model for AI-powered responses.

---

### **Features**

* **Upload Knowledge**: Users can upload custom knowledge files (text, JSON, etc.).
* **Natural Language Queries**: Users can prompt the model with queries related to their uploaded knowledge.
* **AI-Powered Responses**: Powered by DeepSeek, the system retrieves and generates contextually relevant answers.
* **Responsive UI**: Designed using **Angular 19** with **Material UI** for an intuitive user experience.

---

### **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**: Angular 19, Material UI
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
* **AI Integration**: FastAPI (Python) for generating embeddings and interacting with the DeepSeek model
* **Database**: Postgres DB for knowledge upload (future plans for S3 integration)

---

### **Setup and Installation**

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aroo530/Knowledge-hub.git
cd Knowledge-hub
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

* **For the Angular frontend**:

  ```bash
  cd angular-app
  npm install
  ```

* **For the Node.js backend**:

  ```bash
  cd ../backend
  npm install
  ```

* **For the Python FastAPI service**:

  ```bash
  cd pythonEmbeddingsGen
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### 3. Start the services

* **Frontend (Angular)**:

  ```bash
  cd angular-app
  ng serve
  ```

* **Backend (Node.js/Express)**:

  ```bash
  cd ../backend
  npm start
  ```

* **AI Service (FastAPI)**:

  ```bash
  cd pythonEmbeddingsGen
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```

#### 4. Access the app

* The **Angular frontend** should be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
* The **Node.js backend** will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
* The **FastAPI service** should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### **Usage**

1. **Upload Knowledge**: After logging into the app, navigate to the "Upload Knowledge" section and upload your custom knowledge file.
2. **Query the Model**: Once the knowledge is uploaded, you can use the chat interface to ask questions about the uploaded content. The system will use the **DeepSeek model** to generate answers based on the context of your uploaded knowledge.

### **Future Improvements**

* **File storage integrations**: Integrating S3 for better storage and scalability.
* **Model Enhancements**: Improving the AI model and adding support for more complex queries.
